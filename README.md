## First git status output:

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

## Second git status output:

On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

## Purpose of the following Commands:

- `mkdir`: To allow users to create a new directory from Git bash.
- `cd`: To allow user move to the new directory the created from 
Git bash.
- `code`: To allow user open new directory in Visual Studio Code 
from git bash.
- `ls`: With this command, users can check and take record of files
in the directory.

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

- Track, compare, and make changes to different directory.
- Work on a group project without conflit.
- Identify and understand previous annotated changes.
- Combine changes made by different group members.

## Purpose of the following Git Commands

- `git init`: To allow users to create a git repository
in a new directory probably when working on a different project.
- `git status`: To allow users to get information about changes 
made to a local repository. With this command, users can keep 
track of the changes the made to there local repository.
- `git add`: To allow users to add changes made in the repository
files to a staging area.
- `git commit`: To allow users to record staged changes to the local
repository.
- `git push`: To allow users to push changes made in a local 
repository to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: TO allow users fetch and merge changes made in the 
remote repository into a local repository. 
- `git log`: TO allow users to see the list of past commit made a
Git repository's history.
- `git branch`: To allow users to make changes to a branch without
 affecting the base branch or codes.
- `git merge`: To allow users to combine changes from different branches 
to a single branch.
- `git checkout`: To allow users to switch between different branches.
